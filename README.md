# House Price Prediction and Explanation App

This project is a machine learning web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts house prices based on the **Boston House Price Dataset** using an XGBoost regression model. The app also uses OpenAI's language model (GPT-4) to explain the predicted price based on the features provided.

## Project Overview

This web application allows users to input various features of a house and receive a predicted price based on a trained XGBoost model. Additionally, it generates an explanation for the predicted price using OpenAI's language model based on the input features provided by the user. If no valid input is given, the LLM will notify the user that no features were provided.

## Features

- **House Price Prediction**: Predict house prices using a trained machine learning model based on user input features such as median income, house age, number of rooms, and more.
- **Explanation Generation**: The app uses OpenAI's GPT model to explain the predicted price by considering the factors provided.
- **Error Handling**: If no inputs are provided or if they are invalid, the LLM will return an appropriate response without generating explanations.
  
## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/JavedKhaan/Price_Prediction_of_Houses_and_Explanation_App.git
cd Price_Prediction_of_Houses_and_Explanation_App



## Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the following dependencies are included:

streamlit
xgboost
joblib
langchain
python-dotenv

## Add Your OpenAI API Key
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your OpenAI API key like this:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

## Load the Trained Model
Ensure the pre-trained XGBoost model (trained_model.pkl) is in the root directory. If you want to use your own model, replace the file with your trained model.

## Run the Application
Start the app by running the following command:

## streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application locally on http://localhost:8501/.

## How to Use
Input House Features: Enter values for median income, house age, number of rooms, and other features.
Click 'Predict': The app will predict the house price and display it.
LLM Explanation: The app provides an explanation of the prediction using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## Inputs:
MedInc: Median income in the area.
HouseAge: Age of the house.
AveRooms: Average number of rooms.
AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms.
Population: Population of the area.
AveOccup: Average number of people per household.
Latitude: Latitude of the house location.
Longitude: Longitude of the house location.

## Outputs:
Predicted House Price: Displays the predicted house price.
Explanation: A detailed explanation of the price based on input features and market context, generated by the LLM.

## Future Improvements
Add additional house features to improve model accuracy.
Integrate a database to store user inputs and predictions for analysis.
Allow the LLM to give more detailed market recommendations based on inputs.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Model file not found: Ensure that the trained_model.pkl file is in the correct directory.
OpenAI API Key not set: Make sure the .env file is correctly configured with your OpenAI API key.
Dependencies not installed: Double-check that all packages in requirements.txt are installed.
